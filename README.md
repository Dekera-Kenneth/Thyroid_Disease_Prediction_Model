# Thyroid Disease Prediction Model
Based on patient data, this repository contains a machine-learning model designed to predict thyroid diseases, such as hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. The model leverages various algorithms to analyze clinical features like hormone levels (T3, T4, TSH) and patient demographics.

# Features
Input Data: Clinical parameters including hormone levels, age, and gender.
Algorithms: Implemented using Random Forests and Support Vector Machines.
Performance Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC curves.
# Usage
You could clone the repository and follow the instructions in the notebooks or scripts directory to train and evaluate the model on your dataset. The model is designed to assist in the early diagnosis of thyroid diseases, potentially improving treatment outcomes.

# Requirements
Python 3
sci-kit-learn
pandas
NumPy
matplotlib
